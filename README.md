Generally speaking, error handling is divided into two broad categories: exceptions and return values. Rust opts for return values.
the key to ergonomic error handling is reducing the amount of explicit case analysis the programmer has to do while keeping code composable.

Keeping code composable is important, because without that requirement, we could panic whenever we come across something unexpected. (panic causes the current task to unwind, and in most cases, the entire program aborts.)

The Option type is a way to use Rust's type system to express the possibility of absence. Encoding the possibility of absence into the type system is an important concept because it will cause the compiler to force the programmer to handle that absence.

The unwrap method abstracts away the case analysis. This is precisely the thing that makes unwrap ergonomic to use. Unfortunately, that panic! means that unwrap is not composable: it is the bull in the china shop.

Rust has parametric polymorphism, so it is very easy to define a combinator that abstracts this pattern

The Option type has many other combinators defined in the standard library. It is a good idea to skim this list and familiarize yourself with what's available‚Äîthey can often reduce case analysis for you. Familiarizing yourself with these combinators will pay dividends because many of them are also defined (with similar semantics) for Result, which we will talk about next.

Combinators make using types like Option ergonomic because they reduce explicit case analysis. They are also composable because they permit the caller to handle the possibility of absence in their own way. Methods like unwrap remove choices because they will panic if Option<T> is None.

[https://medium.com/@knoldus/combinators-a-functional-approach-of-error-handling-in-rust-4580fb841cb5]

The Result type is a richer version of Option. Instead of expressing the possibility of absence like Option does, Result expresses the possibility of error. Usually, the error is used to explain why the execution of some computation failed. This is a strictly more general form of Option.
The Result type is a way of representing one of two possible outcomes in a computation. By convention, one outcome is meant to be expected or ‚ÄúOk‚Äù while the other outcome is meant to be unexpected or ‚ÄúErr‚Äù.

Just like Option, the Result type also has an unwrap method defined in the standard library.

This is effectively the same as our definition for Option::unwrap, except it includes the error value in the panic! message. This makes debugging easier, but it also requires us to add a Debug constraint on the E type parameter (which represents our error type). Since the vast majority of types should satisfy the Debug constraint, this tends to work out in practice. (Debug on a type simply means that there's a reasonable way to print a human-readable description of values with that type.)

This is rather unsightly, and if this happened inside a library you're using, you might be understandably annoyed. Instead, we should try to handle the error in our function and let the caller decide what to do. This means changing the return type of double_number. But to what? Well, that requires looking at the signature of the parse method in the standard library:

Certainly, it's possible that this could have returned an Option. After all, a string either parses as a number or it doesn't, right? That's certainly a reasonable way to go, but the implementation internally distinguishes why the string didn't parse as an integer. (Whether it's an empty string, an invalid digit, too big or too small.) Therefore, using a Result makes sense because we want to provide more information than simply ‚Äúabsence.‚Äù We want to say why the parsing failed. You should try to emulate this line of reasoning when faced with a choice between Option and Result. If you can provide detailed error information, then you probably should.

pretty hard line against calling methods like unwrap that could panic and abort your program.

However, unwrap can still be used judiciously. What exactly justifies use of unwrap is somewhat of a grey area and reasonable people can disagree. I'll summarize some of my opinions on the matter.

In examples and quick 'n' dirty code. Sometimes you're writing examples or a quick program, and error handling simply isn't important. Beating the convenience of unwrap can be hard in such scenarios, so it is very appealing.
When panicking indicates a bug in the program. When the invariants of your code should prevent a certain case from happening (like, say, popping from an empty stack), then panicking can be permissible. This is because it exposes a bug in your program. This can be explicit, like from an assert! failing, or it could be because your index into an array was out of bounds.

expect does exactly the same thing as unwrap, except it prints a message you give to expect. This makes the resulting panic a bit nicer to deal with, since it will show your message instead of ‚Äúcalled unwrap on a None value.‚Äù

## Rust

not mandatory to have new() constructor

to use the Trait, need to pull the Trait into the module

to explicitly convert a slice into byte slice (as using Try_From is generic, it cannot infer the type and do automatic conversion)...

```
// Method 1
Request::try_from(&buffer as &[u8]);

// Method 2
Request::try_from(&buffer[..]);
```

### Error Handling

[Error Handling in Rust - Let's Get Rusty YouTube](https://youtu.be/wM6o70NAWUI) \

[To Panic or not to Panic](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-03-to-panic-or-not-to-panic.html) \

[Recoverable Errors with Result](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html)

// Unlike other languages, Rust differentiates between Recoverable and Unrecoverable Errors

// Use panic only in exceptional circumstances when cannot recover from the error
**Irrecoverable Error**

# panic!("crash and burn");

in terminal, RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run()

# unwrap();

expect(<'custom error message'>);

It's the situation your code is in, that makes the difference. If your code cannot meaningfully continue without the unwrapped value, choose expect() . If you can respond to there not being a value, pick unwrap() instead, after verifying the value's existence

---

**Recoverable Error**

# match Result<File, Error> ...

# ? = A Shortcut for Propagating Errors to the Calling Code

the ? Operator. The calling code will then decide to panic or do something else eg using default file or default username etc

# ok_or = Transforms the Option<T> into a Result<T, E>

let (method, request) = get_next_word(request).ok_or(ParseError::InvalidRequest)?; // Transforms the Option<T> into a Result<T, E>, mapping Some(v) to Ok(v) and None to Err(err) THEN uses the ? operator to 'unwrap' the result

# if let Some(i)... Since we care only about a single variant (Some) and can safely ignore other variant (None), then we can use if let rather than match or x.if_some(), if let Some(i) makes the code cleaner

## Arrays & Vectors

```
// Arrays [T, N] fixed length

let a = [1, 2, 3]; 	// [i32, 3]
a.length;
a.iter();

// Vectors Vec<T> or [T] growable
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
v.length;
v.iter();

```

## STRINGS

&str: just to view it

String: own & manipulate it

```
let s1 = "hello";                         // &str
let s2 = String::from("hello world");     // &str -> String
let s3 = "Hello World".to_string();       // &str -> String
let s4 = "Hey World".to_owned();          // &str -> String
let s5 = &s4[..];                         // String -> &str

// Manipulating Strings
let s6 = String::from("foo");
s6.push_str("bar");                       // String -> String
s6.replace_range(..., "baz");             // String -> String

// Concantenating Strings
let s7 = String::from("Hello, ");
let s8 = String::from("World");
let s9 = s7 + &s8;                        // String + &str -> String // s7 moved

let s10 = String::from("Hello, ");
let s11 = String::from("World");
let s12 = format!("{} {} {}", s10, s11, "toe");     // String + String + &str -> String // format macro not as efficient as will copy. format macro can take String or &str

let s13 = ["first", "second"].concat();    // &str + &str -> String
let s14 = format!("{} {}", "first", "second");  // &str + &str -> String
let s15 = concat!("first", "second");     // &str + &str -> &str

let s16 = String::from("test");
let s17 = s16 + "okok";                   // String + &str -> String

// Indexing into String
let s18 = "üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè";
let s19 = &s18[0..4];                     // if using emoji, will be 4 bytes

// Rust uses utf-8 for its character encoding
1     // 1 byte
2     // 1 byte
üòº    // 4 bytes

for b in "üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè".bytes() {
      println!("{}", b);
}

for c in "üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè".chars() {
      println!("{}", c);
}

use unicode_segmentation::UnicodeSegmentation;
for g in "üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè".graphemes(is_extended: true) {
      println!("{}", g);
}

// Strings in Functions
let s20 = "Hello World";
let s21 = String::from("Hello World");

my_function(s20);                   // BOTH OK (to pass in Strings or string slices due to deref coercion)
my_function(&s21);                   // BOTH OK (to pass in Strings or string slices due to deref coercion)

fn my_function(a: &str) -> String {
      return format!("{}", a);
}

```
